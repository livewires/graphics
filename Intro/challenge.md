# CHALLENGE - UI and navigation

Instead of just screenshotting you file you could learn to make it look better by doing a nice [render](../Rendering/learn.md).

You could also read [this](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/areas.html) to learn how you can customise the Blender interface.  Give it a go.  It will become very useful later!
