# Screenshots

To take a screenshot of a part of your screen you'll need the shortcuts:

Windows: <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>

Mac: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>

Then use your mouse to drag over the area you want to capture.

On Windows the screenshot is in your clipboard so you can paste it straight into Slack.  On Mac it will be saved as a file to your desktop.
