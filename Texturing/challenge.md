# CHALLENGE - Texturing

So far we've just been painting base colour but there are other things we can paint.
If you haven't already looked at the [materials](../Materials/learn.md) page take a look at that first.
In the material lesson we change the material for the whole object but what if we want to change the material for just one part?
By painting other things (eg. "Roughness" or "Metallic") we can change the material properties for different parts of the object.

Have an experiment and see what you can do!  This is a bit more challenging so if you get stuck at all please ask for help!
